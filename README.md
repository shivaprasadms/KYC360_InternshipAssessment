# KYC360-InternshipAssessment

### Nuget packages used :
- Faker.NET & Bogus to generate in-memory dummy data to mock database
- Autofac for simple dependency injection.
- MSTest for unit testing Retry mechanism.

Persistent storage can be implemented and concurrency/multithreading features such as async/await & TPL library can be used instead of in-memory objects

Retry & Backoff mechanism demonstrates a simple way of mocking database failure.
